# stable-diffusion
## This is for understanding to stable-diffusion. I build stable-diffusion following  this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI). Stable-diffusion is structed 4 parts. These are Auto-Encoder, CLIP, latents space and scadualer. All of these parts are builded for pytorch and in sd directory. You can execute this code for inference.py in sd directory and test model with two ways which are image-to-image and text-to image. If you want to test image-to-image, just write image path in input_image you want to direct for condition. Also, If you want to test text-to-image, leave it as is. Unfortunately, there is no ckpt file due to lack of memory in my local envirment. Thus, before you excute inference.py, you should download ckpt file in [here](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main). Any version of ckpt is possible.
